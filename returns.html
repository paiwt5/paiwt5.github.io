<b>Our Guarantee — 100% Satisfaction.</b><br>

Paiwt's guarantee policy dates back to 2010. If you are not completely satisfied with the quality of the merchandise you receive, you are entitled to a full replacement or refund of the merchandise value up to one year from time of purchase. Details and limitations of our policy are listed below.
<br><br>
<b>Our Return Policy</b><br>
Paiwt will refund the full merchandise value up to one year from the time of purchase. Items must be returned within 30 days of receipt and in their original packaging and resalable condition. Return freight that is sent back to Paiwt is the responsibility of the customer unless: a) Paiwt Customer Service is notified within 30 days of receipt, AND b) the item received arrived damaged, OR c) the item received was not what was ordered. Paiwt is not responsible for any lost or stolen packages.
<br><br>
<b>Cancelled Orders</b><br>
If you cancel or change an order after it has been placed, you can be assessed up to a 15% restocking fee. Items must be returned within 30 days of receipt and in their original packaging and resalable condition. For merchandise valued at $300 or more that has correctly shipped and is undamaged, a 15% restocking fee will apply. This applies to organizations or schools that either 1) cannot accept delivery of the product or 2) no longer need it. Please contact Paiwt Customer Service for more information.
<br><br><b>
Upon Receipt of Your Order</b><br>
Be sure to count parcels and inspect the shipment before signing the delivery receipt. If damage or shortage is apparent upon receiving your shipment, please note it on the delivery receipt. Have the delivery driver sign the receipt and verify that there is damage. Save the damaged package or carton for inspection.
<br>
Open all packages immediately and inspect merchandise to verify it is in good condition. If concealed damage (damage to materials inside a package with no external damage evident) is uncovered, notify us at once. Pictures of the damage is encouraged for all truck shipments.
<br>
Check your merchandise against the packing slip. If an overage or shortage exists, we require you notify Paiwt Customer Service within 30 days after receipt of your merchandise.
<br><br><b>
Limitations of Liability<br>
</b>By making a purchase from Paiwt, you agree that Paiwt is not responsible for any damage or harm caused by the receipt, possession, storage, use or misuse of the products it sells or the services it provides. You agree that Paiwt shall not be liable for any loss arising from the use of its services or the goods it sells, including but not limited to direct, indirect, special, and consequential losses (e.g., damages caused due to delay, damage caused to artwork, or loss of expected or anticipated profits). Notwithstanding the foregoing, should Paiwt be found liable for any damages, you agree that such liability shall be limited to a maximum of the amount you paid for the product, item, or service at issue. You acknowledge and agree that you bear all risk associated with the receipt, possession, storage and use of products purchased from Paiwt and that you should test the product or service before applying it or otherwise using it in a way. Paiwt is not responsible for use of product or damage for anything other than the product’s intended use.
<br><br><b>
How to Return Items</b><br>
Please contact Paiwt Customer Service for return authorization instructions.
<br></i>
Return shipping can be arranged with the shipper of your choice; however, we do encourage you to use a shipper with a reliable tracking system such as FedEx or UPS. If the shipment is lost or damaged on its way back to Paiwt, you may follow up with the shipper for claim resolution.
<br>
Once a return package has been delivered to our distribution center, please allow 2 weeks for the return to be reviewed and processed.
<br>
When returning factory-shipped or truck-shipped items, please contact Paiwt Customer Service for return authorization instructions.
